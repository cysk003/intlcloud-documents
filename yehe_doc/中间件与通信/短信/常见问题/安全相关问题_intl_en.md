### What is the default sending frequency limit of SMS?
To ensure business and channel security and minimize potential financial losses caused by malicious calls of SMS APIs, the default SMS sending frequency limit is as detailed below:
- For SMS messages with the same content, a maximum of one such message can be sent to the same mobile number within 30 seconds.
- A maximum of 10 messages can be sent to the same mobile number on a calendar day.

Organizational users can log in to the [SMS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/smsv2) to set or modify the corresponding sending frequency limit policy. For detailed directions, please see [Setting Sending Frequency Limit](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35469).

### How do I prevent SMS bombing (cheating)?[](id:Q4)
SMS bombing (cheating) refers to using malicious programs or tools and exploiting vulnerabilities in website clients or servers to send a large number of SMS verification codes to many irrelevant mobile numbers in a period of time (for example, within a day), which cause harassment to such users.
SMS bombing (cheating) not only causes harassment to innocent users, but also leads to a high number of complaints, which makes the SMS channel unavailable and results in economic losses to customers; therefore, preventive measures should be taken in advance.
The figure below shows a real case encountered by a customer (only dozens of messages are sent per day under normal circumstances, but tens of thousands of messages were sent per day during a bombing attack):

In view of the fact that SMS bombing (cheating) attacks are generally initiated by servers, the following comprehensive measures are recommended for defense:

- Limit the number of requests allowed per IP.
- Limit the number of delivery tasks allowed per mobile number. To do so, you can [set the sending frequency limit](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35469) and [configure alarm recipients](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35470).
- [Set over-limit sending notifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35469).
- Log in to the [SMS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/smsv2) to regularly (for example, once every day) view specific statistics and check SMS deliveries. If an exception is found, you can disable the SMS service in the console in emergency circumstances.
