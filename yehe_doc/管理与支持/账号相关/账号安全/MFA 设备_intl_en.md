Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple and effective security authentication method. It adds another layer of account protection in addition to a username and password. An MFA device, also called a dynamic password card or token, is a device that provides this type of secure authentication method. Tencent Cloud currently provides virtual MFA devices.


## Virtual MFA Device
A virtual MFA device is an application program that generates dynamic authentication codes. It is compliant with the time-based one-time password (TOTP) standard as defined in RFC 6238. Tencent Cloud's virtual MFA devices are currently only supported by Google Authenticator.
