If your business bandwidth is higher than the guaranteed bandwidth, fees are charged according to actual usage.
- Before upgrading, please check whether your account has sufficient frozen amount. The default frozen amount ratio is 40% for enhanced 95th percentile bandwidth packages for BGP IPs and 60% for enhanced 95th percentile bandwidth packages for static single-line IPs.
