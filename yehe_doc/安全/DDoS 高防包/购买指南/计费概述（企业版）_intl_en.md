## Billing Mode
The billing mode of Anti-DDoS Pro (Enterprise) varies by the region of your application.
- Chinese mainland: Base protection + elastic protection
- Outside the Chinese mainland: Tencent Cloud Anti-DDoS cleansing center provides an all-out protection

>?
>- Chinese mainland regions: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou
>- Outside the Chinese mainland: Hong Kong (China), Singapore, Tokyo, Jakarta, Silicon Valley, Frankfurt, Virginia, São Paulo
>- All-out protection: Integrating the local cleansing capability, the all-out protection aims to spare no effort to successfully defend against each DDoS attack. Tbps-level protection capability is provided in and outside the Chinese mainland.

Anti-DDoS Pro (Enterprise) takes effect only after binding it with an Anti DDoS EIP. You need to change the cloud IP to Anti DDoS EIP. Anti-DDoS Pro (Enterprise) must be located in the same region with the bound cloud resource, and the Anti DDoS EIP is billed when it is created.

The billing details are as below:

>- 95th percentile bandwidth: In each calendar month, the inbound/outbound bandwidth is sampled every 5 minutes and the maximum is taken as the peak bandwidth on each day. At the end of the month, the sampled values are sorted from highest to lowest, and the top 5% are removed. The 95th largest value is the billable bandwidth of the month.
>- For a 10-IP plan, 50 Mbps of application bandwidth is offered for free by default.

### Elastic protection
You can enable elastic protection as needed.
- If elastic protection is not enabled for an instance, its maximum protection will be the base protection bandwidth, and no extra fees will be incurred.
- If elastic protection is enabled for an instance, its maximum protection will be the selected elastic protection bandwidth.
  - If elastic protection is not triggered, no charges will be incurred.
  - Elastic protection will be triggered when the peak attack traffic exceeds the base protection bandwidth. You will be billed at the tier corresponding to the amount of usage for the current day (Peak attack bandwidth – Base protection bandwidth) and settled on the following day.

Elastic bandwidth cap is the overall amount of multiple ISP bandwidth limits. Note that blocking may occur when attack traffic exceeds one of the limits even if the overall cap is not reached.
- Billing for postpaid elastic protection of Anti-DDoS Pro (Enterprise): Settled on a calendar day.
- Billable elastic bandwidth = Peak attack bandwidth – Base protection bandwidth

The detailed pricing of elastic protection is as follows:

### Pricing of application bandwidth[](id:yw)
The application bandwidth refers to the normal bandwidth of the protected application. It is billed based on monthly 95th percentile by either the outgoing or incoming traffic (whichever is higher).
