## Scenario
After purchasing or reinstalling CVM, you need to partition and format the data disk. This document describes how to perform partitioning, formatting, and other initialization operations on a data disk on Windows CVM.

## Notes

- Formatting a data disk will erase all data. Please ensure that the data disk does not contain data, or important data has been backed up.
- To avoid service exceptions, ensure before formatting that the CVM has stopped external services.

## Directions

Please select the appropriate operation guide based on disk capacity:
- If the disk capacity is less than 2 TB, please [initializing cloud disks](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/362/31597).
- If the disk capacity is greater than or equal to 2 TB, please [initializing cloud disks](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/362/31598).
