TencentOS Server (aka Tlinux or TS) is a Linux distribution developed by Tencent Cloud for cloud scenarios. It offers specific features and performance optimizations to deliver a higher performance and a more secure and reliable runtime environment for applications in CVM instances. Independently developed and designed based on the Linux kernel on top of Tencent's technical experience accumulated in the field of operating systems over the last decade, TencentOS Server has been verified and improved by Tencent's many internal businesses for many years. It is used as the OS of more than 99% of internal servers in all Tencent businesses. Meanwhile, as Tencent has the widest variety of business ecosystems in China ranging from social networking, gaming, and payment to AI and security, TencentOS Server's core capabilities such as stability, security, compatibility, and performance have been fully proven for a long time. Compared with community OS distributions, TencentOS Server is comprehensively enhanced and optimized in terms of stability, performance, and container infrastructure. It can provide enterprises with stable and highly available services to meet their demanding workload requirements, making it a better enterprise-grade OS solution than CentOS. Tencent Cloud strives to make TencentOS Server the best OS in the cloud.

TencentOS Server is publicly available currently, and its user-mode environment is compatible with CentOS, so applications developed on CentOS can run directly on TencentOS Server.
